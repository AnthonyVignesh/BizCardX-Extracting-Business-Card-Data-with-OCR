# BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR

**Technologies Used :** Python,easy OCR, Streamlit, SQL, Pandas
**About** : Bizcard is a Python application designed to extract information from business cards.
The main purpose of Bizcard is to automate the process of extracting key details from business card images, such as the name, designation, company, contact information, and other relevant data. I was created two tabs as upload & modify and delete the details

**Fetching the data from image:**
- Fetched the data from image and 
- Transformed JSON data to Pandas DataFrames.
- Converted data to CSV format and downloaded to the local environment.

**SQL Integration:**
- Created eight tables in SQL.
- Transferred the data to SQL tables using Python with PostgreSQL connection.

**Streamlit Interface:**
- Utilized Streamlit for the front-end interface.
- Implemented dynamic visualizations using Plotly, including Choropleth maps.
- Enabled user interaction to select options, triggering back-end queries to fetch and process data from SQL.
- Presented visual representations in the Streamlit interface based on user selections.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Presented visual insights in real-time within the Streamlit interface.
   - Utilized Choropleth maps and other Plotly visualizations for effective data representation.

*This project seamlessly integrates data retrieval, transformation, storage in SQL, and dynamic visualization in Streamlit to offer a comprehensive tool for exploring PhonePe Pulse data.*
